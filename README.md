# WAR
This is a single page web app card game that copies the casino version of WAR. High card wins. The player hits the deal button to play a round. Each game goes until the player hits 25pts. 

## Motivation
In wanting to further my exploration into Javascript I decided to re-create the card game WAR.

## Tech/framework/Libraries used
<b>Built with</b>
- Html, Css, Javascript, Bootstrap 3, FontAwesome

## Features
A use seperate functions combined into one controller function through event listeners, and DOM manipulation. Use of .split, .join, parsInt for array manipulation and converToArray to conver Regex to an array for image- score comparison.

## Installation
1.) Download or clone code.
2.) Open index.html in browser.

## Game Usage
* New Deal button - deals a set of cards for player 1 and player 2.
* Highest card of the set wins the round and winner receives 1pt.
* Game goes to 25pts then stops as a winner is determined.
* New Game button starts the game over and scores go back to 0.
